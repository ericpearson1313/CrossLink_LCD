Board Testlist:
----------------
Given a commit id to test on the development board
git pull/checkout the repo commit
sh ./watermark.sh
Lattice Diamond open testgen.lpf
refresh, map, p&R, and bitstream generate bitfile.
after a successful fpga load step through the tests below
recording observations


Dev Board Setup:
------------------------
Dev boards has 4 LEDs and 2 button, organized as a 2x3
D2 / D4
D5 / D3
K2 / K1

They are assigned as:
Blink / Test0
Test1 / Reset
Key0  / Reset(button)

Also the connector J5 the 2x30 header is assigned as:
pin27, K5 is an input of LCD_PWM
pin44, F2 is LCD Reset output.
pin43, F1 is LCS Power enable output


Board Test List:
------------------
** Initial bring-up tests do not need the LCD attached **

1-after configuration is complete reset led is off, no blink intentionally (tinies 3usec flicker should not be visible)

2-The blink led (D2) should be double blinking at a 2hz rate of 0:(*-*-----) or 1:(***-----)
   28 blinks output the git commit id (msb first) followed by a 2 second's off and then repeats. Record the binary stream 

3-the test0,1 leds should be off, (if test1 is high due to pin pullup, jumper K5 to gnd)

4-Both pressing and/or releasing key0 should blink test0 led, 

5-Jumpig the K4 input pin on the dev board (LCD_pwm input?) to logic 1 (3.3v) or logic 0 should be reflected in test1 led

6-pressing and holding Reset button, should cause the Reset LED to stay ON until 100ms after release. Rapidly press and release RIGHT key, should give a 100ms on time minimum.

7-putting a jumper between K4 and F2(lcd_reset) should show low during reset and settle high after the lcd startup sequence.

8-putting a jumper between K4 and F1(lcd_en_pwr) should show low during reset and high as its turned on during the lcd startup

9-Open a terminal on the dev boards uart, the fpga connects the receive to the send with a fixed delay pipeline and should do a loopback echo
