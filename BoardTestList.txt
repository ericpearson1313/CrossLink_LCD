Board Testlist:
----------------
Given a commit id to test on the development board
git pull/checkout the repo commit
sh ./watermark.sh
Lattice Diamond open testgen.lpf
refresh, map, p&R, and bitstream generate bitfile.
after a successful fpga load step through the tests below
recording observations


Dev Board Setup:
------------------------
Dev boards has 4 LEDs and 2 button, organized as a 2x3
D2 / D4
D5 / D3
K2 / K1

They are assigned as:
Blink / Test0
Test1 / Reset_Led
Reset / Key0 

Also the connector J5 the 2x30 header is assigned as:
pin27, K4 is an input of LCD_PWM
pin44, F2 is LCD Reset output.
pin43, F1 is LCS Power enable output


Board Test List:
------------------
** Initial bring-up tests do not need the LCD attached **

1-after configuration is complete Reset_Led is OFF, no blink intentionally (tinies 3usec flicker should not be visible)

2-The Blink led (D2) should be double blinking at a 2hz rate of 0:(*-*-----) or 1:(***-----)
   28 blinks output the git commit id (msb first) followed by a 2 second's off and then repeats. Record the binary stream 

3-the Test0 and Test1 LEDs should be ON

4-Pressing Key0 should turn OFF Test1 led upon release Test1 should be ON 

5-Jumping the K4 input pin on the dev board (LCD_pwm input) to logic 0 should turn OFF Test0.

6-pressing and holding Reset button, should cause the Reset LED to stay ON until 100ms after release. Rapidly press and release Reset button, should give a 100ms ON time minimum.

7-putting a jumper between K4 and F2(lcd_reset) should set Test0 OFF during if Reset is pressed, and ON after reset is complete (100ms after release).

8-putting a jumper between K4 and F1(lcd_en_pwr) should set Test0 OFF when Reset is pressed and ON after reset is complete.

9-Open a terminal on the dev boards uart, the fpga connects the receive to the send with a fixed delay pipeline and should do a loopback echo.
